# CP1404 Practicals

#### Daniel McMahon

## Overview

My name is Daniel McMahon and this repository holds all my practical work for CP1404. I like long walks on the beach and
my two cats.

## Clean Code Principles

- Follow PEP8 Standard.
- Be consistent with naming, and using the correct formatting for each different type.
- Explicit is better than Implicit.
